## Beta Testing

If you would like to enter the beta testing via Test Flight for Wasserflug, please message Jamamp on the Hydravion discord server, or email james.n.linnell@gmail.com with an email and something to fill out for the First and Last name fields in the app store.

## Development

Cloning the git repository and opening/running it in Xcode, with some slight changes for provisioning/signing should be all that is needed at this time. There are some dependencies; please allow time for Xcode to automatically fetch those before/during initial compilation.
